# Orchestrator for RoyalChaos

MVP responsiblities:
- Orchestrate monitoring against a container.
    - Launch & setup royalnetm side-container.
    - Launch & setup royalsysm side-container.
    - Consider switching to graphite as it relies on push model instead of the pull model.
        - probably should highly consider it.
- Verify setup?

Future responsiblites:
- List possible container to select.
- Launch attack on containers.
-

### Mostly for myself, service discovery.
Broadcast works between docker containers, so should be able to do service discovery on local containers.
It would make it possible to shift the model of pushing config down to monitoring services, to them being smarter and able to find their "master server" and configs themself. (if the servers handle responses to that port ofc.)
